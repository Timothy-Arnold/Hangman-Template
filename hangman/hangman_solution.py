    word: str
        The word to be guessed picked randomly from the word_list
    word_guessed: list
        A list of the letters of the word, with '_' for each letter not yet guessed
        For example, if the word is 'apple', the word_guessed list would be ['_', '_', '_', '_', '_']
        If the player guesses 'a', the list would be ['a', '_', '_', '_', '_']
    num_letters: int
        The number of UNIQUE letters in the word that have not been guessed yet
    num_lives: int
        The number of lives the player has

        ----------
        letter: str
            The letter to be checked
